<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Luvkush Gupta, a passionate coder and full-stack web developer with a deep interest in technology and problem-solving. 
  Over the years, I’ve developed multiple projects using a variety of technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, which 
  has allowed me to explore different aspects of web development. Each project presents new challenges, and I love the process of
  figuring out efficient and creative solutions. My drive for continuous learning pushes me to stay updated with new tools and techniques,
  as I’m always excited to enhance my skills and broaden my technical expertise.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I’ve had the privilege of serving as a National Service Scheme (NSS) volunteer for two years. During this time, I actively participated
  in activities that focused on community welfare, such as beach cleaning, tree planting, and organizing blood donation camps. These experiences were not
  just about contributing to society, but they also gave me a sense of fulfillment and responsibility. I learned the importance of teamwork, leadership,
  and making a positive impact, no matter how small it may seem. Volunteering through NSS has deeply influenced my outlook, encouraging me to integrate 
  social responsibility into everything I do, both personally and professionally.</p>
